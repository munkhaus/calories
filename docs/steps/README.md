## Steps documentation

Each implementation step has its own file for clarity and verification. Use the template to add new steps.

Naming: `step-XX-short-title.md` where `XX` is zero-padded order.

Contents per step:
- Context & scope
- Implement (tasks)
- Verify (checks & commands)
- Acceptance criteria / DoD

See `_template.md` for structure and `step-01-routing-and-tabs.md` for a concrete example.
